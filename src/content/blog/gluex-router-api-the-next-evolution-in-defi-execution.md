We are excited to announce the launch of the GlueX Router API, a game-changing infrastructure component that enables seamless execution of DeFi actions across protocols and chains.

With the GlueX Router API, developers and users can now experience frictionless, multi-step DeFi transactionsâ€”whether it's swapping, lending, yield strategies, or LPingâ€”all optimized within a single transaction.

This release marks a major leap forward in DeFi abstraction, setting a new standard for protocol interoperability, execution efficiency, and user experience.

Router API is [now live and ready to integrate](https://docs.gluex.xyz). Whether you're building a trading app, a yield optimizer, or a next-gen DeFi UXâ€”this is the infrastructure layer you've been waiting for.

## What is GlueX Router API?

GlueX Router API is the first execution abstraction layer that allows any-token-to-any-token transactions, no matter the complexity.

Unlike traditional DEX aggregators, GlueX doesnâ€™t just source liquidityâ€”it aggregates everything:

- **DEXs & AMMs** â†’ Curve, Uniswap, Balancerâ€¦

- **Lending & Borrowing Protocols** â†’ Aave, Morpho, Compoundâ€¦

- **Yield Protocols** â†’ Yearn, Pendle, Beefyâ€¦

- **Liquidity Provisioning (LPing)** â†’ Curve, Balancer, Uniswap V2 & V3â€¦

By combining liquidity, routing, and smart execution strategies, GlueX Router API makes DeFi composable like never before.

## Why does it matter?

Whether youâ€™re a developer building a next-gen DeFi app or a user looking for seamless interactions, GlueX Router API brings protocol interoperability to an entirely new level.

- **No More Fragmentation** â€“ No more manually bridging, swapping, and rebalancing between protocols.

- **One-Click Transactions** â€“ Users can execute multi-protocol DeFi actions seamlessly in a single step.

- **Optimized Execution** â€“ The API ensures the best routes, lowest slippage, and most efficient paths for every transaction.

- **Unparalleled Interoperability** â€“ Any token, any protocol, everything is connected into one seamless execution layer.
